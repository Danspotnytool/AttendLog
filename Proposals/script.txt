"Development of Web-based S.O.S game for Entertainment  using Node JS"

BOS
This is a design and implementation of a prototype application using server-side javascript programming language, Node JS as a backend database. It scales and evaluates the developed prototype application like the S.O.S game, Before the game begins, a square grid of at least 3x3 squares in size is drawn. The object of the game is for each player to attempt to create the straight sequence S-O-S among connected squares. If a player succeeds in creating an SOS, that player immediately takes another turn and continues to do so until no SOS can be created on their turn. The goal of this study is to improve the game's scalability and performance. As specified in Node JS website, one of the nodeâ€™s goals is to make an easy way of developing scalable network programs.

SCRIPT:
This server-side JavaScript programming language is like an extended version of JavaScript that enables the back-end access to databases which makes it more secure. It will act or serve like a firewall of the web-based game. Whenever they login incorrectly, will get an error message until you login your access correctly or might get an error message that you attempted multiple times.
